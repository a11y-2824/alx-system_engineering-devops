# Configuration management
Configuration management (CM) refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. <br/>
Even though this process was not originated in the IT industry, the term is broadly used to refer to server configuration management.<br/>
There are a number of configuration management tools available in the market. Puppet, Ansible, Chef and Salt are popular choices. <br/>
Although each tool will have its own characteristics and work in slightly different ways, they are all driven by the same purpose: to make sure the systemâ€™s state matches the state described by your provisioning scripts <br/>
